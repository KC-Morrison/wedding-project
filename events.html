					88-92 Piper St, Lilyfield NSW 2040 <br />
					From 1:00pm April 29, 2023 <br />
					<br />
					For everyone we wish we could have brought with us in our suitcase to
					NZ and wedding guests who want to celebrate again!
					<br />
					This is a kid friendly venue and the outdoor area we have booked is
					also dog friendly (though that is weather dependant). <br />
					Food and drink will be available for purchase so please feel free to
					come and go, eat and drink as it suits you best. <br />
					We'll do a big toast at 3pm but otherwise the afternoon will be
					relaxed. <br />
					??There is parking on-site at the venue (accessible from Charlotte
					Street) and on the surrounding streets including Charlotte St,
					Pretoria St, Piper St and Russell St. Parking in the area is classic
					inner west, not impossible but may require patience. The venue is 500m
					from the Lilyfield light rail station and is also handy to the 370,
					445 and 470 buses.
